Folder "./scully" doesn't seem to contain custom plugins Deprecation Notice:
       ======================================================================
         From now on, the plugin that is being used to render a route is
         able to be changed by the user. You can do this by adding or
         enabling the plugin your scully.devon-web.config.ts
         file. For your convenience, we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

         To disable this warning enable the plugin of your choice.
         for Puppeteer please add:
             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.devon-web.config.ts file.

          When you get this warning while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer
          you need to set the defaultRouteRenderer to the name of your plugin.
          The defaultRouteRenderer is now set to 'routeRenderer'.
       ======================================================================

(You can skip this, or any future question by using the --noPrompt flag)

We encountered a problem while reading the routes from your applications source.
This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.
(You can inspect the error by passing the --showGuessError flag

When there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.
